# Coding Challenges
My solutions to select coding challenges

1. HackerRank
* Array Manipulation  
* Candies
* Frequency Queries  
* Left Rotation  
* Mark and Toys  
* Max Array Sum
* Minimum Swaps 2  
* New Year Chaos  
* Sherlock and Anagrams  
* Sorting Comparator
* Sparse Arrays  

Note that I've made custom input files for some of the scripts (see 'inputs' folder)  
'Outputs' folder houses .txt output files (consistent with HackerRank submission requirements)
     
2. Miscellaneous  
* Clock hand angle (calculate angle between hour and minute hands for a given time)  
* Powerset (create the powerset [set of all possible subsets] of a given set)
